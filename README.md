## 🧠 System Architecture

### Model Selection Process

The system automatically trains and evaluates 4 machine learning models:

| Model | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **XGBoost** | Extreme Gradient Boosting |
| **LightGBM** | Light Gradient Boosting Machine |
| **Random Forest** | Ensemble Decision Trees |
| **Logistic Regression** | Linear baseline model |

**Selection Criteria:** Based on highest AUC-ROC, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score

### Data Flow Pipeline

```
Synthetic Data Generation (100k) 
    → Data Processing & Cleaning 
    → Feature Engineering (52 features) 
    → Model Training & Selection 
    → SHAP Explanations 
    → Streamlit Dashboard
```

## 📝 Note About Power BI References

> **Don't get confused seeing `powerbi/` folders or "export to Power BI" files in the project structure.**  
> 
> These files will work seamlessly with the current system, even though **this system doesn't actually use Power BI**. 
> 
> **Why are they there?**  
> Initially, the plan was to automate the complete process from data visualization to exporting to Power BI and displaying all visuals in Power BI. However, I later realized that achieving complete automation with Power BI is not possible with the free tier.
> 
> **Solution:** I switched to **Streamlit** for the interactive dashboard, which provides:

> - ✅ Completely free and open-source
> - ✅ Full automation capabilities
> - ✅ Easy deployment and sharing
> - ✅ Real-time interactivity
> 
> The Power BI-related files remain in the repository for reference and can be safely ignored. The Streamlit dashboard provides all the visualization functionality you need!
